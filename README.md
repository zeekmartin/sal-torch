**Structurally Adaptive Learning for PyTorch**

Training-time sparsification that makes neural networks structurally resilient to compression.

## Install

```bash
pip install sal-torch            # core
pip install sal-torch[hf]        # + HuggingFace Trainer
pip install sal-torch[all]       # everything
```

```python
from sal import SALConfig, SALCallback

config = SALConfig.auto(model)
trainer = Trainer(model=model, callbacks=[SALCallback(config)])
trainer.train()
```

Three lines. Any transformer. Compression-resilient.

## Know your model before you touch it

### PlasticityScanner — where can a model absorb compression?

FI tells you how fragile a model *is*. `PlasticityScanner` tells you how much
room it has to *reorganize*, so you know where it is safe to compress. It scores
three complementary axes per layer — routing flexibility (attention entropy),
inter-layer redundancy (linear CKA), and intra-layer redundancy (an MI proxy) —
and folds them into an **absorption map** that labels each layer `ELASTIC`
(safe), `SATURATED` (bottleneck), or `HUB` (compensates when others are pruned).

```python
from sal import PlasticityScanner

pmap = PlasticityScanner(model, probe_dataset).scan()
print(pmap.summary)              # "3 elastic, 1 saturated, 2 hub | mean routing=0.61 ..."

rec = pmap.recommend(target_compression=0.33)
rec.safe_to_prune                # [(layer, head), ...] — prune these first
rec.never_touch                  # heads in hub layers — leave alone
rec.expected_impact              # heuristic accuracy delta

pmap.save("plasticity.json")     # raw scores
pmap.save("plasticity.pdf")      # visual report (needs sal-torch[reports])
```

### sal.compare() — SAL vs. other pruning methods

Benchmark SAL against post-hoc baselines at a matched compression level and see
which keeps the most accuracy (or lowest loss) after heads are removed.

```python
from sal import compare

result = compare(model, train_dataset, eval_dataset,
                 methods=["sal", "magnitude", "random_posthoc"],
                 compression=0.33, sal_epochs=3, metric="accuracy")
print(result.table)              # method | score | pruned_heads | time
print(result.winner)
result.save("comparison.pdf")    # bar chart + table

# plug in your own method
compare.register_method("my_pruner", lambda model, ds, eval_ds, ctx: my_score)
```

## Continual learning without replay buffers

### StructuralGuard — protect what matters when you fine-tune

When you fine-tune a trained model on a new task, it quietly overwrites the
structure that carried the old one. `StructuralGuard` reads the model's
structural map and **freezes the critical attention heads** (hub layers,
structural bottlenecks, and the functionally unique heads) while leaving the
redundant heads free to absorb the new task. No EWC, no replay buffer, no
distillation — the topology itself decides what to protect.

```python
from sal import StructuralGuard

# After training on task A, build a guard from the model's structure.
guard = StructuralGuard.from_model(model, probe_dataset, protection_level=0.5)

print(guard.protected_heads)   # [(layer, head), ...] frozen during fine-tuning
print(guard.trainable_heads)   # [(layer, head), ...] free to absorb task B
print(guard.protection_map)    # {layer: [protected head indices]}

guard.protect(model)           # zero gradients for protected heads (backward hooks)
trainer.train()                # fine-tune on task B with ANY training loop
guard.release(model)

drift = guard.measure_drift(model, probe_dataset=probe_dataset)
print(drift.forgetting_score)      # 0 = nothing forgot, 1 = total reorganization
print(drift.protected_integrity)   # ~1.0 if the protected heads held

guard.save("model_guard.json")     # serialize; reload before task C, D, ...
guard = StructuralGuard.load("model_guard.json")
```

Protection is at the **head level** — some heads in a layer can be frozen while
others in the same layer keep learning. `protection_level` (0.0–1.0) sets the
fraction of the most critical heads to protect.

HuggingFace `Trainer`? Use the callback — it applies protection on
`train_begin`, measures drift on `train_end`:

```python
from sal import StructuralGuardCallback

guard = StructuralGuard.from_model(model, probe_dataset)
callback = StructuralGuardCallback(guard)
trainer = Trainer(model=model, callbacks=[callback])
trainer.train()
print(callback.drift_report.summary)
```

### DriftMonitor — measure structural forgetting after any fine-tuning

`DriftMonitor` quantifies how much a model's structure moved, guarded or not.
Snapshot before and after, then compare.

```python
from sal import DriftMonitor

monitor = DriftMonitor(model, probe_dataset)
monitor.snapshot("before_task_b")
trainer.train()
monitor.snapshot("after_task_b")

drift = monitor.compare("before_task_b", "after_task_b")
print(drift.summary)
print(drift.layer_drift)             # per-layer activation retention (1 = identical)
print(drift.classification_changes)  # layers whose fragility class flipped
drift.save("drift_report.json")
drift.save("drift_report.pdf")       # visual before/after comparison
```

Snapshots are keyed, so you can track drift across many sequential tasks and
compare any pair.
